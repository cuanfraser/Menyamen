# Milestone 6 - Refactoring Report
**Team members: Manvi Tandon and Cuan Fraser**  
**Menyamen/p6-refactoring:**
## Plan
- Add instructor tests for TestLevel to fix 4-in.json, 5-in.json, and 6-in.json 
- Add unit tests for level, hallway, and room to do further testing 
- Change string outputs to enums for interactions
## Changes
- Added more unit tests for hallways, levels, and rooms
- Updates launch.json to account for these added tests
- Realized there is an issue with the construction of our hallways (Milestone 4 has 3 tests failing)
## Future Work
- There needs to be debugging done to figure out what is failing when we generate our levels.
## Conclusion
- Continue writing tests cases for all given use cases 
- Go babck to old milestones and fix the tests that are failing
