When the game is initialized the program will set up a 2D array representing the grid consisting of tiles. It will also keep track of the order of players as they join within an Array. And an array of adversaries created by another developer. The game board consists of Tile pieces that hold Players, GameObjects such as the key and the exit portal, as well as the adversaries. Common knowledge will include the x and y positions of each tile, whether a tile is occupied by a player or adversary, and whether a tile is a path.  Our milestones are listed below: 

Milestone 1: Design and plan our software system, send to get client approval  
Milestone 2: Basic skeleton set up of our model [classes, interface]  
Milestone 3: Basic game logic method implementation [moving tile, initializing objects]  
Milestone 4: Basic working prototype to demo to client for feedback   
Milestone 5: Client feedback analysis guides further development   
Milestone 6: Implementing more rigorous testing and polish methods   
Milestone 7: Quality assurance and final testing
